# For tidy parameter tables with CIs
library(parameters)
library(merDeriv)

# Example 1: two-occasion data (Chp. 3- Hoffman) ==============================

# getting the DATA:
dataset <- read.csv("ex1/Example_1.csv")

head(dataset)
glimpse(dataset)

# preparing the DATA for MLM analysis:
# Converting data from wide to long\stacked format
dataset.long <- dataset %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(T1, T2), 
               names_to = "Time", 
               values_to = "outcome") %>% 
  mutate(
    Time = ifelse(Time == "T1", 0, 1),
    group = group - 1
  )
# Note, we centered time to the first assessment! -> "T1" is 0.
# We also centered group so that group 1 is 0.
# We will talk more about centering in the future... For now, just think of the 
# making the predictors' 0 point *meaningful*. 
# (We could have also just converted these into factors)

head(dataset.long)


## Spaghetti plots -------------------------------------------------
# First, lets' just see the patterns in the data:

# Spaghetti plots- change in outcome by time:
p_spaghetti <- ggplot(dataset.long, aes(x = Time, y = outcome, color = factor(PersonID)))+
  # add a line for each ID but don't show use a legend
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  # add the pattern of the mean slope (linear pattern)
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, 
              color = "black", linewidth = 2) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1)) + 
  labs(x = "Time", y = "outcome") # use axis labels...
p_spaghetti

# split to groups:
p_spaghetti + 
  facet_wrap(~ group)


## Empty Model ---------------------------------------------------------------
# AKA intercept-only models

## Empty BP Model:
#-> simply using lm()
Model.empty.lm <- lm(outcome ~ 1,       # 1 is for including the intercept
                     data = dataset.long)
summary(Model.empty.lm)

# Tidy parameters:
model_parameters(Model.empty.lm)

# and yes, this intercept is just the outcome mean ...
psych::describe(dataset.long$outcome)

## Empty WP Model(=random intercept model):
#-> now we need lmer() for MLM (i.e. adding RANDOM effects, here- random intercept)
Model.empty.mlm <- lmer(outcome ~ 1 +
                          # the syntax start the same for FIXED effects (i.e., intercept)
                          (1 | PersonID),
                        # BUT, we will add the RANDOM effects with Wilkinson's notation:
                        # (the random variable\s | the grouping variable, usually ID)
                        REML = TRUE, # This is default (we can omit this argument) 
                                    # set to FALSE for ML fitting
                        data = dataset.long) 

summary(Model.empty.mlm) # Satterthwaite's method is the default
summary(Model.empty.mlm, ddf="Kenward-Roger") # we can change it to "KR"

# see tidy parameters:
model_parameters(Model.empty.mlm, ci_method = "Satterthwaite") # Can also write ci_method = "S"
model_parameters(Model.empty.mlm, ci_method = "KR")

# Check out that the output refers to:
# 1. Fixed effects (model of the means)
# 2. Random effects (model of the variances\SDs)


### Computing ICC ------------------------------

# We use the empty model for producing the intra-class correlation (ICC),
# Which is actually:

# BP variance:  Sigma{a} square / Total variance (Sigma{a} square + Sigma{e} square)
#               Tau square      / Total variance (Tau square + Sigma square)

(3.50)^2 / ((3.50)^2 + (5.31)^2)

# OR....
# just use the icc() function from "performance" library.
icc(Model.empty.mlm)

# (For empty models, "Adjusted" and "Conditional" ICC are actually unconditional ICCs,
# For now- ignore Adjusted/ Conditional)



## Conditional model (=none empty) ---------------------------------------------------------

# Effects are conditioned on some predictor(s)

# We will add the group*time FIXED effects.
# That is, time effect, group effect, and their interaction. 

# Ignoring the idea that we measured each person twice - a BP model:
BPModel.con <- lm(outcome ~ Time * group ,
                  data = dataset.long)
model_parameters(BPModel.con)

# Interaction is not significant - there is much uncertainty about the estimate.

# The same model- accounting for the variance in the intercept (a WP model)
WPModel.con <- lmer(outcome ~ Time * group + (1 | PersonID),
                    data = dataset.long)
model_parameters(WPModel.con, ci_method = "S")
# The interaction's SE, CIs and p have changed - why?


# Pretty tables:
sjPlot::tab_model(BPModel.con, WPModel.con, 
                  show.se= TRUE,
                  df.method= "satterthwaite")

# NOTE: The intercept is the only random effect in the model. That and the
# nature of the design, means that this is not different from repeated measures
# ANOVA (besides of using REML and not OLS).

afex::aov_ez("PersonID", "outcome", dataset.long,
             between = "group", within = "Time")
# Notice that the df and p value for the interaction are identical!
# (They are NOT the same for Time and group - in the ANOVA they are main effect,
# in the LMM they are simple effects.)


### Simple slopes analysis --------------------------

# For significant interaction we would like to test simple slopes 
# in our case we can see the slopes for Time=0 or group=0, but what about
# Time=1 or group=1?

emm_options(lmer.df = "satterthwaite") # setting the emm options to use 
                                       # satterthwaite df

# use emmeans's emtrends() function:
TrendsByGroup <- emtrends(WPModel.con, # the model
                          var = 'Time', # the IV
                          ~group , # the moderator
                          at = list(group = c(0, 1))) 
summary(TrendsByGroup, infer = TRUE)

# see how Time effect for group 0 is equal to the effect of time
# in the main model:
model_parameters(WPModel.con, ci_method = "S")



### Random effects ----------------------------------

# lme4 (and lmerTest) have several new functions that allow us to extract the
# predicted group-wise estimated parameters = the random effects.
#
# ranef() give the deviation of each random parameter from the fixed parameter:
ranef(WPModel.con) # If we had random slopes, they would appear as additional columns

# coef() gived the actual group-wise effects:
coef(WPModel.con)
# Note that the effects for Time, group, and Time:group do NOT differ between
# subjects - these either were not modeled as random effects (e.g. Time) or are
# level 2 effects (so they cannot differ between subjects!)
